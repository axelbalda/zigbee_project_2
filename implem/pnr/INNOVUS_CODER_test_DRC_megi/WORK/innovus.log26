**WARN: (IMPLF-228):	 ANTENNAOUTPUTDIFFAREA is specified and will be
applied to any OUTPUT PIN or INOUT PIN without ANTENNADIFFAREA. This often
causes a mismatch between process antenna violations found in Innovus
(during routing or verification) and violations found by external physical
verification tools. This global defaulting mechanism is obsolete in LEF
5.5. The recommended solution is to remove ANTENNAOUTPUTDIFFAREA and add
ANTENNADIFFAREA to all OUTPUT or INOUT PINS in the MACROS in order to
avoid a mismatch in violations.
**WARN: (IMPLF-230):	 ANTENNAINOUTDIFFAREA is specified and will be
applied to any INOUT PIN without ANTENNADIFFAREA. This often causes a
mismatch between process antenna violations found in Innovus (during
routing or verification) and violations found by external physical
verification tools. This global defaulting mechanism is obsolete in

and add ANTENNADIFFAREA to all INOUT PINS in the MACROS in order to
avoid a mismatch in violations.

In a new session, the capacitance table files can be removed from the create_rc_corner command to enable the technology file to be used for preRoute and postRoute (effort level medium/high/signoff) extraction engines.

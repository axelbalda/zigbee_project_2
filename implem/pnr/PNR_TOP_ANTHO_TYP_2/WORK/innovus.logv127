[06/14 19:58:33    948s] *info:     1 net(s): Could not be fixed because the solution degraded timing.
[06/14 19:58:33    948s] *info:     2 net(s): Could not be fixed because the location check has rejected the overall buffering solution.
[06/14 19:58:33    948s] *info:    25 net(s): Could not be fixed because of no legal loc.
[06/14 19:58:33    948s] *info:    11 net(s): Could not be fixed because there is no usable buffer or delay cell for buffering.

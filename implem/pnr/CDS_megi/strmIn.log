WARNING (XSTRM-84): The 'Skip Undefined LPPs' option will be ignored because a new library is being created.
WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'test_drc' is attached to the technology library 'TECH_C35B4'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /softl1/AMS_410_ISR15/cds/HK_C35/TECH_C35B4/TECH_C35B4.layermap
WARNING (XSTRM-31): Layer map file '/softl1/AMS_410_ISR15/cds/HK_C35/TECH_C35B4/TECH_C35B4.layermap' contains duplicate entries for Stream layer:datatype '42:10' at line number '79'. This record will be ignored. Remove the duplicate entry from the layer map file and then translate again.
WARNING (XSTRM-31): Layer map file '/softl1/AMS_410_ISR15/cds/HK_C35/TECH_C35B4/TECH_C35B4.layermap' contains duplicate entries for Stream layer:datatype '65:62' at line number '193'. This record will be ignored. Remove the duplicate entry from the layer map file and then translate again.

INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the viaMap option. If a viaMap file, corresponding techfile or technology library exist, then use the -viaMap option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design. For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.

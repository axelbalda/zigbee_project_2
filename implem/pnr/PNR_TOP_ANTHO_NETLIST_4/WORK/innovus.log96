**WARN: (IMPLF-228):	 ANTENNAOUTPUTDIFFAREA is specified and will be
applied to any OUTPUT PIN or INOUT PIN without ANTENNADIFFAREA. This often
causes a mismatch between process antenna violations found in Innovus
(during routing or verification) and violations found by external physical
verification tools. This global defaulting mechanism is obsolete in LEF
5.5. The recommended solution is to remove ANTENNAOUTPUTDIFFAREA and add
ANTENNADIFFAREA to all OUTPUT or INOUT PINS in the MACROS in order to
avoid a mismatch in violations.
**WARN: (IMPLF-230):	 ANTENNAINOUTDIFFAREA is specified and will be
applied to any INOUT PIN without ANTENNADIFFAREA. This often causes a
mismatch between process antenna violations found in Innovus (during
routing or verification) and violations found by external physical
verification tools. This global defaulting mechanism is obsolete in
LEF 5.5. The recommended solution is to remove ANTENNAINOUTDIFFAREA
and add ANTENNADIFFAREA to all INOUT PINS in the MACROS in order to
avoid a mismatch in violations.
